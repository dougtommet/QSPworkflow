# QSPworkflow

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of QSPworkflow is to put the workflow tools used by QSP into one place.

Currently, the only function is **network_path()**.  Planned work includes functions that set up the directory structure and file structure.

## Installation

You can install the  development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dougtommet/QSPworkflow")
```
## Example


```{r example}
library(QSPworkflow)
my_project <- fs::path(network_path(), "Projects", "My_Project")
my_project
# df <- readr::read_csv(fs::path(my_project, "my_data.csv"))
```
